/// # Weighted Round-Robin Arbiter (`cc_wrr_arbiter`)
///
/// A generic, N-input arbiter that merges `NumIn` valid/ready input streams onto a single
/// valid/ready output stream while distributing the output bandwidth *proportionally to a
/// per-input weight* `weights_i[i]`. Under saturation (every input always requesting) input
/// `i` receives a steady-state share of
///
///     bandwidth_i = w_i / sum_j(w_j)        (j over all currently-contending inputs)
///
/// This is the knob the WRRA exposes: a requester with a higher weight `w_i` is granted more
/// of the shared link, which is exactly what is needed to counteract *topological unfairness*
/// in a NoC. When a chain/tree of these arbiters merges traffic towards a common destination,
/// setting each input's weight to the number of original requesters it aggregates restores
/// global fairness (each leaf source ends up with an equal share, regardless of how many hops
/// deep it sits). Weights are additive up the tree, so the same cell composes at any radix.
///
/// ## Mechanism: deficit / burst weighted round-robin
///
/// The weight is realised as a *burst*: when an input wins arbitration it is granted up to
/// `w_i` consecutive flits (one flit = one valid/ready transfer) before the round-robin pointer
/// advances to the next contender. Over a full rotation that visits every contender once, input
/// `i` therefore emits `w_i` out of `sum_j(w_j)` flits, giving the bandwidth split above.
///
/// Design decisions (and their trade-offs):
/// * **Reuse `cc_rr_arb_tree` for winner selection.** The inner arbiter (with `FairArb` and
///   `LockIn`) decides *who* wins and *holds that decision* for the whole burst; the wrra cell only
///   adds the burst counter on top. The inner `gnt_i` is pulsed exactly once per burst (on the
///   last accepted flit) so the inner round-robin pointer moves once per burst, not once per
///   flit. We feed the inner arbiter a *snapshot* of the contender set (`req_lock_q`) that is held
///   stable for the whole burst, which keeps the `LockIn` decision stable even if a non-winning
///   input deasserts, and avoids tripping the inner arbiter's `LockIn` assumptions.
/// * **Burst vs. interleaved.** A burst arbiter is small and simple but makes the output bursty:
///   a low-weight input may wait through a full high-weight burst, so its *latency/jitter* is
///   worse than with a (more expensive) interleaved/WFQ-style scheme. The bandwidth ratio is
///   identical either way, so for bandwidth shaping under contention the burst scheme is chosen.
/// * **The burst length is a *maximum*, not a guarantee of work.** A burst advances on accepted
///   flits (`req_o & gnt_i`). A downstream stall (`gnt_i` low while the winner still requests) just
///   pauses the burst. But if the winner *withdraws* its request mid-burst - including being masked
///   out by an upstream QoS/priority stage - the burst is **abandoned** and the arbiter re-arbitrates
///   to the next contender (`winner_gone`). This keeps the cell work-conserving and, crucially,
///   prevents a permanent stall when this cell is wrapped by a dynamic eligibility mask (see
///   `cc_qos_wrr_arbiter`). Under saturated traffic the winner never withdraws, so the bandwidth
///   ratio is exact; under non-saturation it degrades gracefully towards the offered load.
/// * **Weight of 0 means "no service".** An input whose weight is 0 is excluded from arbitration
///   entirely: it is skipped and never granted, even while it is requesting (it gets zero
///   bandwidth, as the weight says). This also keeps the burst counter from ever loading 0. If
///   *every* requesting input has weight 0, the output simply stays idle.
